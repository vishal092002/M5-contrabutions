<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The issue that i was having for this week was not with the<br>systemd files but it was with trying to connect my VM to the<br>group VM that we have to use for the project.&nbsp; The issue that<br>I was having was that I needed to find a certain file that<br>I needed to change the IP{ so that I would be able to<br>connect. The reason I was getting this error was because the syntax of<br>the find function that I was using was incorrect. After I was able<br>to fix this issue, I was able to work on the systemd work<br>for this week without any issues.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
